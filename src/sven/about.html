      hi, i'm sven. i'm a non-binary glaceon with a pension for being (loosely) pragmatic,
      dabbling in music, configuration, and being a complete ass.
    <p>
      i don't do much legwork anymore, as i mainly just hang around and do whatever for fun.
      like remaking my website again, in absolute pain.
    <p>
      i do not have a defined sexuality, nor a gender.
    </p>
